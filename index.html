                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm 19 years old and pursing a career in web development. I started coding in middle school with scratch and kodu. I would make games and sometimes try and re-create
                    the classics like Pacman and Space Invaders. Eventually I was introduced to code academy and from there I learned html and css. These first two languages kept my 
                    curiosity throughout middle and high school until I eventually joined a coding bootcamp, where I learned those two languages in a week and began to dive into the depths
                    of web development. I can't count how many times my mind has been blown or I've just gotten super excited about learning something new, because this stuff is cool.
                    That's part of why I choose to go into web development. The possibilities of what a website can be and do is truly only limited to the ideas you can come up with, and
                    you never stop learning. Everytime I code I'm either learning something new or refining my skills and becoming better. I love it all. Even the bugs.
